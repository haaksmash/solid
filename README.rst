solid
=====
A state machine implementation for Python --- which *isn't* solely designed to parse strings!


why state machines?
------------------
They're cool! Also, easy to reason about --- a state machine design enables you
to compartmentalize responsibilites in a way that functions simply don't.


why "solid"?
------------
It's a convoluted name: it's a state machine library written in python;
snake is another word for python that sounds like state --- and Solid Snake is
a fairly well known character who kicks serious butt. Thus, "solid".
